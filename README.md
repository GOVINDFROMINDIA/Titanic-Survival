##### Analyzing the survivors of Titanic and checking out whether a person would make it out alive or not!!
**EASTER EGG: Jack won't make it, while Rose will**


*The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous tragedies in history, and predicting the survival of passengers on board remains a topic of interest. In this study, we implemented a prediction model using the random forest algorithm to assess the likelihood of a person surviving the Titanic disaster based on a variety of features, including age, gender, class, and embarkation point. We utilized a dataset that contained information on 891 passengers and their survival status, which was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. The results showed that the random forest model had an accuracy of approximately 82%, indicating that it could predict survival with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Furthermore, we examined the importance of each feature in the model, finding that gender and class were the most significant predictors of survival. These findings suggest that the random forest algorithm can be a valuable tool in predicting survival in similar situations and may have implications for disaster planning and response strategies.*
